## Explainable-AI

![HPP](https://github.com/n0nsense-404/Explainable-AI/assets/76699273/afc59194-ec90-42a3-b0f1-be6921abdfc8)




This project empowers humans to understand the "why" behind AI decisions by exploring Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. We demonstrate XAI with two practical models: house price prediction and Titanic survivor prediction.

Project Structure:
    House Price Prediction: Contains datasets used for training and testing the House Price Model
    Titanic Survivor Predicion: Contains datasets used for training and testing the Titanic survival prediction model.
    main: Contains the Streamlit code for building the interactive website.

**Technologies Used:**

* **Python:** The primary programming language for building the AI models and XAI implementations.
* **Streamlit:** A Python framework used to create the interactive web application for user interaction and XAI explanation visualization.
* **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** An XAI technique integrated into the house price prediction model to explain its decisions.
* **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):** An XAI technique employed in the Titanic survival prediction model for interpretability.
